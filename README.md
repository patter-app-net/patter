patter-mod
==========

A major refactoring of Patter into many modules.

## Setting up patter

Everything depends on you having node, npm, and grunt-cli installed. We are going to install all the dependencies and then setup a config file.

Your `/config.json` files should have your app client_id and should look like this:

```json
{
    "patter_client_id": "PSeXh2zXVCABT3DqCKBSfZMFZCemvWez"
}
```

### Run these commands to get started

Before getting started make sure you have created a config.json file.

```sh
>>> npm install
>>> grunt server
```

You should now be able to navigate to http://localhost:9001 and see your local copy of patter running.

### To Distribute Patter

Once you are finished developing patter you can then distribute patter to a production environment. To do so you must generate a version of patter, and then copy all the files to your webserver.

For example:

```sh
>>> grunt dist
>>> rsync -avzt dist/* username@remote.host:/var/www/patter.example.com/
```

Once all your files are uploaded you should then have a working version of patter.
